# NLP-WEB-APPLICATION
# Description

This is a web-based application developed using Flask. Once the user registers with the website, he/she can log in to his/her account.
Post login, the user would be given 3 functionality to choose from:-



### 1. Named Entity Recognition
### 2. Sentiment Analysis
### 3. Abuse Detection
<br />
The user can then choose any one of the functionality and proceed forward by adding the text on which he/she intended to perform the functionality.
Once the user adds the text to perform the desired functionality, the website hits the specific API taken from ''Komprehend AI API'' and fetches 
the result which is shown to the user.<br /><br />

Tech used are:-
<br />

1. HTML
   
2. Flask
 
3. API from Komprehend AI API
